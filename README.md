# Youtube-playlist-duration

This is a simple python and js code to get the duration of a youtube playlist. Keep in mind that the playlist has to be either **PUBLIC** or **UNLISTED** due to the fact that selenium starts with its own temporary profile (this means no private playlists).

To use the code you just need to paste the playlist url.
